          I know what it's like having read so many self development books and
          sitting in front of a therapist thinking... Uhhmm I think I know more
          than you do! I know what it's like feeling like you have this big AHA
          moment, discovering a pattern that has been troubling you over and
          over again.. to only find out months later when you fall flat on your
          face again... that AHA moment, was just a piece of a very big and
          seemingly ENDLESS puzzle. I know what it's like to feel like you're
          healing journey is never ending (which it technically is) and
          sometimes even feels like you take 1 step forward and 2 steps back.
          I've been there, done that and it sucks!

          Before I became an integrated attachment practitioner, I was actually
          a client like you.. I had spent many days searching for the right
          therapist, wondering what's wrong with me and self analysing through
          the internets. After going through a period of attachment coaching
          myself, I began to make big leaps of progress that I had never made
          before. Patterns that I had battled with for years, melted away like
          snow, my self loathing turned into self compassion & self confidence
        </p>

        <p>
          And the best part ?! I was getting to the root cause of my problems
          and solving for them in a matter of weeks instead of years.
        </p>

        <p>
          Once I finished I was so in awe of my own results I became dedicated
          to letting the world know about this. Fast forward 6 years later my
          heart jumps for joy seeing countless of clients go through that same
          fundemental transformation in such short amounts of time.
