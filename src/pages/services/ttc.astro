      <h3>Build your way to a secure attachment style</h3>
      <p>
        Integated Attachment Theory (IAT) is a modality that is designed to help
        transform an insecure attachment style into a secure one within weeks.
        IAT holds 5 key pillars that are used to asses and help correct insecure
        attachment programming. IAT doesn't only help you to gain awareness. It
        also truly helps you transform painful attachment habits that are at the
        core of sabotaging your relationships. The one you have to yourself and
        to others.
